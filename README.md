# Project Magic Binder

Magic Deckbox is a full-stack web application to keep track of your magic collection. It provides an inventory of your Magic card collection by adding, deleting, and editing your inventory using the Magic The Gathering API and the Mongo/PostgreSQL database (I havenâ€™t decided on what kind of database I am having yet).
